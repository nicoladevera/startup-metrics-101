Create a responsive, browser-based educational web application called "Startup Metrics Explained" (or similar) that helps startup employees and aspiring startup workers understand 15 key business metrics through interactive calculators and clear explanations.
Design Requirements
Visual Style

Professional yet approachable aesthetic
Clean, modern interface with good use of whitespace
Color scheme: Use a professional palette with strategic use of color for feedback (green for healthy metrics, amber/yellow for warning, red for concerning)
Typography: Clear, readable fonts suitable for both explanatory text and numbers
Not gamified or childish, but not corporate/dry either
Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

Navigation Structure
Homepage:

Display all 15 metrics as an organized grid or list
Each metric should show:

Metric name
One-sentence description
Icon or visual identifier
Clickable to navigate to dedicated metric page


Include a brief introduction explaining what the app is for
Optional: Search or filter functionality to find specific metrics

Individual Metric Pages:

Clear header with metric name
Back button to return to homepage
Organized into sections (see Content Structure below)
Smooth scrolling for longer pages
Sticky/fixed navigation element to return to homepage

Content Structure (for each of the 15 metrics)
Each metric page should contain the following sections in this order:
1. Definition Section
Content to include:
- Clear, jargon-free definition (use the definitions we created)
- Simple analogy where applicable
- Add tooltips/hover definitions for any technical terms (like "COGS", "variable costs", "churn", etc.)
2. Why It Matters Section
Content to include:
- Explanation of why founders, VCs, and board members care about this metric
- What insights it provides about business health
- What good vs. bad values typically look like
3. Sample Calculation Section
Content to include:
- The formula written clearly (both in mathematical notation and plain language)
- A worked example with realistic numbers
- Step-by-step breakdown of the calculation
4. Interactive Calculator Section
User Experience:

Input fields for each variable in the formula
Each input should have:

Label clearly indicating what the input represents
Number input field (allow decimal values where appropriate)
Slider control that syncs with the number input (define appropriate min/max ranges)
Unit indicator (e.g., "$", "%", "months")


Real-time calculation that updates as user types or moves sliders
Large, prominent display of the calculated result
Visual indicator showing if the result is:

Green zone: Healthy/good metric
Yellow zone: Acceptable but could be better
Red zone: Concerning/needs improvement


Include a brief explanation below the result explaining why it falls in that zone

Visual Feedback Examples:
For LTV:CAC Ratio:
- Green: ≥ 3.0 ("Excellent! Your unit economics are healthy")
- Yellow: 1.5 - 2.9 ("Acceptable, but aim for 3:1 or better")
- Red: < 1.5 ("Warning: You're spending too much to acquire customers")

For Monthly Churn Rate:
- Green: ≤ 2% ("Excellent retention!")
- Yellow: 2-5% ("Acceptable for early-stage")
- Red: > 5% ("High churn - focus on retention")
5. Visualization Section (where relevant)
Include charts/graphs for metrics where visualization adds value:

MRR/ARR: Line chart showing growth over time based on user inputs
Burn Rate + Runway: Visual "runway" gauge or bar chart
Churn Rate: Visual representation of customer retention/loss
Growth Rate: Bar chart or line chart showing month-over-month or year-over-year growth
LTV vs CAC: Side-by-side bar comparison
Use a charting library like Chart.js, Recharts, or similar

6. Beginner Tips Section
Content to include:
- 3-5 practical tips for understanding or improving this metric
- Common benchmarks for different types of startups (SaaS, hardware, marketplace, etc.)
- When to focus on this metric (early stage vs. growth stage)
7. Common Mistakes Section
Content to include:
- 3-4 common errors or misconceptions about this metric
- What to avoid when calculating or interpreting
- Pitfalls in trying to optimize this metric
The 15 Metrics to Include
Include these metrics in this order, with all content structured as specified above:

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
Burn Rate
Runway
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Lifetime Value (LTV)
LTV:CAC Ratio
Churn Rate
Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
Gross Margin

Technical Requirements
Technology Stack Recommendations

Frontend Framework: React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, or custom CSS

Variable costs
Fixed costs
Churn
Expansion revenue
Upsell
Downsell
ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
